# mapGenerator
Map Generating Java Script Project
The aim of this project was to create a JS app which allows a user to generate a random map, based on a pre-set collection of connectable tiles. 

Key learnings from this project:
1. JS does not natively have the ability to create multidimensional arrays
2. How to access and rewrite data in arrays
3. How to loop through functions
