# mapGenerator
Map Generating Java Script Project
The aim of this project was to create a JS app which allows a user to generate a random map, based on a pre-set collection of connectable tiles. Making art with code!
This will get added to Avid Research.

Key learnings from this project:
1. JS does not natively have the ability to create multidimensional arrays
2. How to access and rewrite data in arrays
3. How to loop through functions
4. How to use maths in JS
5. How to collect user data and employ it meaningfully
